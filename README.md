Homework 2 - Data Collection  
Due 1/24/2025

Data Collection:
1. Explain your data collection process. 
    ***
2. What instrument did you use to collect data with? 
    The instrument used to collect data with was a ruler.
3. Argue the accuracy and precision of your instrument. 
    ***
4. How many data points did you collect? Why? 
    10 data points for each of the 3 plants. I chose this because one, I was outsourcing my data and didn't want to overwhelm them, but even if I had been collecting it myself I wouldn't have taken an insane amount of data points because I think the important part is learning how to visualize and analyze it. To me, measuring X plants Y amount of times for the purposes of learning how to collect data is no different with 30 total leaves and 90 total leaves measured.
5. Define the size of your data in terms of both N (full data set size) and n (each subset size). 
    ***
6. Explain any problems that you ran into during the data collection process.
    No problems were run into during the data collection process.

Visualization & Analysis:

1. Explain each graph in terms of variance, mean, median, and standard deviation. 
    Mean leaf length: on average the length of the leaves in the dataset is around 5.025in. This means that in the histogram/boxplot the data should be clustered around 5.025in.
        (same for leaf width except it's about 3.59in)

    Median leaf length: half of the leaf lengths in the dataset are above 4.5in and half are below. In the boxplot it's the horizontal line inside the box that divides the data in half.
        (same for width except it's 3.0)

    Leaf length variance: ~15.49 is high variance, meaning the lengths of th e leaves vary widely from the mean. The histogram will have a wider spread - more data points will be farther from the mean. Higher variance = greater diversity in leaf lengths (this will be shown by the range of values in the histogram.)
        Leaf width variance: the leaf width variance is 5.34, so lower. It means that leaf widths are closer to the mean (don't you love stats terminology? let's use common english words, nothing bad can happen! couldn't be confusing at all!) The distribution in the leaf width's histogram would be concentrated around the mean and have less values at the extremes in comparison to the leaf length's

    Leaf length standard deviation: 3.94 (sqrt of the variance). It means that most of the lengths of the leaves fall within 3.94in of the mean, both half above it and half below it. Most of the data would be around there in the histogram, and its shape would reflect how the data is spread out. Bigger std dev = wider spread of data. The boxplot will haver a bigger IQR and longer whiskers.
        leaf width standard deviation: 2.31 - the leaf widths are less spread out than the mean, and the data will be more packed around 3.59in in the histogram. The boxplot will ahve a smaller IQR (less variability)
    
    As for the scatter plot, in general the leaf length will be more spread out (as discussed above, bigger range and variance), so the data points will more widely span along the x-axis for leaf length. Leaf width is going to be more packed and will show the smaller variance and std dev as discussed above.

2. What can you infer with data and graphs that you have? 
Leaf length:
    The distribution for leaf length is skewed to the right (positively skewed) bc the bigger values are bringing the mean higher than the median 
    The variance (15.49) and std dev (3.94) are high so there is high variability in leaf length (not clustered together)
    The large std dev means most of the lengths deviate a notable degree from the mean (5.025in) meaning the dataset would have a mix of small and large values (which is true, one of the plants has itty bitty leaves)

Leaf width:
    Since the mean is higher than median, it will be skewed to the right but not as much as the leaf length, so there are some 'larger' leaf widths.
    The variance (5.34) and std dev (2.31) are lower than the variance and std dev of the leaf length. This means the width data will be less spread out, and more packed around the mean and median. There will also be less outliers

Tbh I could go through each graph itself again but that would just be repetitive and i ain't tryna make you read allat twice. i kind of put the answer of both questions in #1 oops
And obviously all of the logical/mathematical analysis can be compared to the actual graphs generated by the program
